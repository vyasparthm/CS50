'''
In a file called interpreter.py, implement a program that prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and then calculates and outputs the result as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place.
Assume that the userâ€™s input will be formatted as x y z, with one space between x and y and one space between y and z, wherein:

    x is an integer
    y is +, -, *, or /
    z is an integer
For instance, if the user inputs 1 + 1, your program should output 2.0. Assume that, if y is /, then z will not be 0.

def main():
    x,y,z = input('Expression: ').split()
    x = int(x)
    z = int(z)
    print(interpreter(x,y,z))

def interpreter(a,b,c):
    if b == '+':
        return f'Detected: Addition, Result: {a + c:.1f}'
    elif b == '-':
        return f'Detected: Subtraction, Result: {a - c:.1f}'
    elif b == '/':
        return f'Detected: Division, Result: {a / c:.1f}'
    elif b == '*':
        return f'Detected: Multiplication, Result: {a * c:.1f}'
    else:
        return 'Invalid operation!'
