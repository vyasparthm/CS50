'''
When texting or tweeting, it's not uncommon to shorten words to save time or space, as by omitting vowels, much like Twitter was originally called twttr.
In a file called twttr.py,
 implement a program that prompts the user for a str of text and then outputs that same text
   but with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, whether inputted in uppercase or lowercase.
